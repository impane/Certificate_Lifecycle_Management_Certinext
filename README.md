Certificate Lifecycle Management

CertiNext by eMudhra is a comprehensive, enterprise-grade Certificate Lifecycle Management (CLM) platform.
It is designed to automate and centralize the management of all digital certificates (SSL/TLS, S/MIME, Code Signing, IoT, etc.) across an organization's entire infrastructure, whether it's on-premise, in a hybrid environment, or in a multi-cloud setup.
Essentially, it's a tool that takes the manual effort and risk out of managing the growing number of digital certificates.


1. Key Functions and Features:
Full Lifecycle Automation: It manages the entire lifespan of a certificate, including:
1. Issuance: Automating the request, approval, and provisioning process.
2. Discovery: Using tools like the emSign Bot (which was mentioned in your initial description) to find and inventory all certificates, even in isolated networks.
3. Monitoring & Alerts: Tracking expiration dates in real-time and sending automated alerts to prevent outages.
4. Renewal: Automating the certificate renewal process to ensure zero downtime.
5. Revocation: Handling the instant revocation of compromised or unused certificates.


2. CA-Agnostic and Integrations: It is designed to work with certificates issued by multiple Certificate Authorities (CAs), not just eMudhra's own CA. It integrates with enterprise systems, including:
1. Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS)
2. Other third-party CAs (like Entrust, Let's Encrypt)
3. Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)
4. DevOps toolchains via REST APIs and ACME protocol.

3. Centralized Control & Visibility:
   It provides a unified dashboard for a holistic view of the entire certificate inventory, helping organizations maintain compliance and identify vulnerabilities.
   
5. Future-Ready Security:
6. It often includes support for advanced concepts like Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) readiness and built-in Key Management capabilities.
